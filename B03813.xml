            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>And Petitions to the Lords of Their MAJESTIES Privy Council</p>
               <p>The Appeal given in by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> to the Synod of <hi>Midlothian,</hi> containing a ſhort Information of the Progreſs of that Proceſs, to that time, is as follows.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MOderator, Being conſcious of my Innocence, and finding my ſelf Wronged, and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I here Appeal from this Synod, to the firſt <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> when it ſhall meet; And in the mean time to their <hi>Majeſties Protection,</hi> for Juſtice and Relief; And ſince the Law allows the Liedges a competent time to give in the Reaſons of their appealls, I here Proteſt within Twentie four hours, to give in the Reaſons of this my appeal to your Clerk; And withall, I proteſt that this be Recorded by him. And upon all I take Inſtruments.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reaſons of Appeal of Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> from the Synod of <hi>Midlothian,</hi> to the next Lawful <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> And to their MAJESTIES Protection for Juſtice, and Relief in the mean time.</head>
               <p>THERE being a Lybel given in to the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> and the Lybel bearing it to be given in in the Name of the Parochiners, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> and Parochiners compeared, and craved that the Ingivers of the Lybel might be condeſcended upon, and that they might owne and ſubſcribe it; And that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the ſaid Heretors and Parochioners did not only <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> but by a Write under their Hands Diſclaim and Diſowne it except <hi>Alexander Calderwoode,</hi> and a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>popall.</hi> And albeit no Lybel ought to be admitted without a Purſuer; yet the Presbytery refuſed to condeſcend upon the Ingivers of the Lybel, or to ordain them to owne and ſubſcribe it. Likeas, none had the confidence to owne it, except the ſaid <hi>Alexander Calderwood,</hi> who ſat among them as one of the Ruling Elders, and who is notourly known to be the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi>'s declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (althô without cauſe) and who invented and reported moſt falſe Calumnies againſt him, of which when he was challenged, his anſwer was, That whether they were true or falſe, he had thereupon taken two hundred of the Parochioners from his Communion; And a Declinator being given in againſt him as Informer and Promotter of the Lybel, which not only conſiſted in the knowledge of the Presbytery (who had no other Information but his) but which was likewayes offered to be proven be his Oath; yet notwithſtanding thereof, againſt all Law, Reaſon, and good Order, the Presbytery would not remove him, but allowed him to ſit as one of Mr <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Judges, and appointed him one of the Examinators of the Witneſſes: And he forgetting that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, informed and tampered with ſome of them, and threatned others, as to what they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone; And the Witneſſes being overawed and interrupted in their Examinations, and not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to declare the hail Truth in complext matters of Fact, whereby the Depoſitions may be lame and weak, and carry a quite contrary meaning of the Truth, of what the Witneſſes offered to depone; And ſome of the Witneſſes having deſired that they might ſee and read their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions before they ſubſcribed them, the ſame was abſolutely refuſed, with this Expoſtulation, What? do you diſtruſt us? and do you queſtion our Clerk's honeſty? And thus they cauſed theſe Witneſſes ſubſcribe what was written, ſo that there may be left out the material parts of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which cleared their Miniſter. And not only are there ſeveral Articles of the Lybel, which are not upon theſe Heads, to which the Trial of the <hi>Regular Clergy</hi> is reſtricted be Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and which are in themſelves <hi>alterius fori,</hi> but likewayes there was an additional Lybel raiſed againſt the ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander,</hi> and without any Citation given to him thereupon, or Coppy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175916:2"/>
Sight or Notice given to him thereof; Witneſſes are examined, then all which there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in judicial Procedures more Partial, Pernicious, and Unjuſt. And Mr <hi>Alexander Herriot</hi> having appealled from the Presbytery to the General Aſſembly, the Presbytery notwithſtanding thereof proceeded, and found the Lybel Relevant and Proven; and therefore, and in regard of Mr <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Contumacy (as they termed his Appeal to the General Aſſembly, which ſat in <hi>October</hi> laſt) they ſuſpended him from the Miniſtry, and referred him for further Cenſure to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly. But the General Aſſembly having found no Contumacy in the Appeal, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to the Synod. And now the ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> does again Appeal from the Synod, and from any Sentence they ſhall give in this Matter, to the next lawful General Aſſembly, and in the mean time, to Their Majeſties Protection for Juſtice and Relief. For thir Grounds and Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primo,</hi> There being a Petition given in by the Heretors and Parochioners of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to the Synod, atteſting, the ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> his Faithfulneſs in the Miniſtry, and his Innocency as to the things Lybelled againſt him; and craving, that according to the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Witneſſes might be made patent, that they might be the better Redargued; yet the Synod ſuffered not the ſaid Petition to be read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundo,</hi> The ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> having repreſented to the Synod the foreſaid Procedure of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery againſt him, and having craved that the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, might be read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and that he might have a Coppie of the Aditional Lybel, which he had never ſeen; and that conform to the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes might be made pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to him, to the end that he might have a Coppy thereof, to the effect he might the better clear himſelf, from any thing that may ſeem to be deponed againſt him; yet notwithſtanding thereof, (and contrare to Law) the ſame was alſo refuſed by the Synod, and undoubtedly for this Reaſon, That the Probation was weak, and might not abide the Light nor Trial, for <hi>Veritas non quaerit Angulos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertio,</hi> The ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> repreſented to the Synod, That he was informed that one of the Articles deponed againſt him, was, That he ſhould have danced about a Bonfire the 14 of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1688; And that the ſame was the only Article proven againſt him, which he inſtantly redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, for the ſaid 14 day of <hi>October</hi> 1688 fell upon a Sunday, and that the Witneſſes and haill Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> cannot but declare, that there was never Bonfires at <hi>Dalkeith</hi> upon a Sunday, ſo that they deponed falſly. And the Dancing about a Bonfire being ſo publick an Act, that not only the Witneſſes that have deponed it, but likewayes many others would have ſeen it, and all the Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> would have heard of it, if it had been true: Yet notwithſtanding thereof, all the Neighbours to that Bonfire, and hail Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> will declare and depone, that they neither ſaw nor heard of their Miniſter dancing at that, or any other Bonfire; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> Conviction, and redarguing of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Synod had no regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, affirming that there was no help for it now, it being ſo deponed, which is no other thing than as if they had ſaid, that they were not concerned thô it were falſe, for it was ſo deponed; and which is ſo conſequential to a clear and poſitive Redarguing, and Improbation of the Article, and Probation thereof, that the prejudice and deſign of the Synod to proceed againſt the ſaid Mr <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> upon whatever was alleadged, althô without Probation, or upon a Redargued Probation, is evidently manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quarto,</hi> The ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> repreſented to the Synod, that he had formerly Appealled from the Presbytery, and that it was but too evident from what is above narrated, that they were his Party. And which was further demonſtrate from this, That, the ſaid Presbytery and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Calderwood,</hi> did in face of the Synod not only interrupt the ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> when he was ſpeaking; but likewayes debated and reaſoned againſt him as Parties, ſo that it could not but be expected, but that they would do more when he was removed out of the Synod, and therefore the ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander</hi> declined the Presbytery, and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> as his Judges, and craved that they might not fit to judge him; yet notwithſtanding thereof, againſt all Law and Juſtice, they were not removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quinto.</hi> Several Members of the Synod interrupted the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> while he was Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating himſelf, in the face of the Synod, and craving a ſight of the Additional Lybel, and Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Witneſſes; And cryed out, That <hi>the ſame ſhould not be granted to him,</hi> as if every one of them had had a Deciſive Voice, and which is without Example in any Judicatory, for any of the Judges to interrupt the Defenders ſpeaking, and to cry out their Opinion, or rather Sentence, before the Defender be removed; And which openly diſcovers their Prejudice, Deſign and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of proceeding againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> altho without juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:175916:2"/>
                  <hi>Sexto.</hi> The Prejudice and Deſign of the Synods proceeding againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> on the ſaid lame, weak, and null probation, is evident, in ſo far as ſeveral Members of their Number did ſpeak and deall with him to demitt, or that otherwayes they would depoſe him. And there is no thing more certain, than that they would never have Dealt with him to demitt, if the Probation againſt him had been good; Their malice to the <hi>Regular Clergie</hi> being ſuch, as that they would rather Depoſe them for Immoralities, and Errors in Doctrine to Publiſh them, than to ſuffer them to Demit, and get off without ſtaine, when they are guilty of the ſame. But Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcious of his own Innocency refuſed to Demit, but rather to ſuffer there Extreamity, from which he hoped GOD in his good time would Vindicate him. And therefore it being evident from the Grounds forſaid, that the Synod has behaved themſelves moſt partially, and againſt all Law and Forme: The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> does therefore Proteſt againſt the Synods further Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſaid Matter, and appeals from them, and from any ſentence they ſhall give therein, to the next <hi>General Aſſemblies,</hi> And to their MAJESTIES Protection, for Juſtice, and Relief in the mean time; And Proteſts, That the ſaid Lybels, and Witneſſes Depoſitions taken thereupon, may be preſerved, and not put out of the way, That ſo the ſame (and not Copies thereof) may be produced to the next <hi>General Aſſembly;</hi> Or to any their Majeſties ſhall be pleaſed, out of their Royal Authority, to appoint to conſider the ſame: And that as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and diſperſe his Appeal, and his Anſwers to the firſt Lybel; Which he only did ſee for his own Vindication from any ſentence that ſhall follow hereupon; So he expects, and earneſtly Deſires, that the ſaid Synod may Print both the Lybels againſt him, and Depoſitions taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for vindication of their Juſtice, (if they can conceive they have done right:) But which Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> hopes will rather vindicate his Innocency. And further, Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> Craves, and Proteſts, That this his Appeal may be inſert in the Books of the Synod.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of the Appeals foreſaid, the Synod proceeded, and Depoſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> from his Miniſtrie, And thereupon the Elderſhip of the Pariſh was invaded, and ſome few, (ſeverals of them ſcarce worth to be noticed as Reſidenters,) have uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the power of electing Elders, and have elected many moe than the number formerly uſed, purpoſely as they think, to make the greater Figure; altho but of the moſt inconſiderable of the Paroch; And of Deſign to Call, Impoſe, and Obtrude a Miniſter upon the Reſt againſt their will, contrare to the Laws of Charitie, Practices of Chriſtian Churches, and profeſſion of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. Notwthſtanding, that the ſaid Mr <hi>Alexander Heriott</hi> his Appeal does preſerve his Right, and keeps all in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> the time of the Appeal, while it be diſcuſt.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, not only the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriott,</hi> but likewiſe the Heritors and Pariſhoners of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> have given in a Petition to the Lords of their <hi>Majeſties</hi> moſt Honourable Privy Council, That they may be pleaſed to diſcharge the Calling of a Miniſter while the Appeal be diſcuſt; And that in the mean time, he may be reſtored to the Exerciſe of his Miniſtrie. And that the Presbytrie of <hi>Dalkeith;</hi> And others havers of the Lybels given in againſt him, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Witneſſes may make the ſame patent to him, as Law appoints; That he may know what is lybelled, or may ſeem to be proven, to the effect he may the better clear himſelf of the ſamen, which is nothing but falſe lyes and calumnies: And whereof ſeverals of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters, who have ſeen the Lybels and Depoſitions; Affirm, that there is nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But the dancing about the Bon-Fire, which is not only clearly redargued to be falſe as ſaid is, there being no Bonfires either on the foreſaid day, nor for ſeveral moneths either before or after; But likewiſe if the perſons who have deponed it were known, and re-examined, it will be found, they have deponed falſly; And that they have been dealt with ſo to Depone; And that this Falſhood may not be diſcovered, not only are the Depoſitions kept up, contrar to expreſs Law and Act of Parliament; But likewiſe, no notice can be gotten who were the perſons who have deponed it, that they may be inſiſted againſt.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the Lords of their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Privy Counſel, are not Judges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the ſentences of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts,</hi> and that as they cannot put in Miniſters in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſo they cannot meddle with ſentences of Depoſitions. It is anſwered, 1 <hi>mo.</hi> That be the 1: <hi>Act</hi> 8 <hi>Parl: Ja:</hi> 6: It is Statute and Ordained, <hi>That his Majeſtie, and Council ſhall be Judges competent, To all Perſons Spiritual and Temporal, in all matters.</hi> And to pretend, that the Council is not Judge competent to ſentences of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts,</hi> is no other then to affirm, <hi>That theſe Courts have an Arbitrary power, and may do wrong at their pleaſure without Remeed or Controll.</hi> For it is evident, That <hi>Mr. Herriot</hi> is moſt unjuſtly purſued and Depoſed. And it is alſo evident, that if it be not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175916:3"/>
be the Council, he will never be Reſtored be thoſe Miniſters, who have dealt ſo unjuſtly with him.</p>
               <p>And whereas, it is alleadged, <hi>That as the Council cannot put in Miniſters, ſo they cannot meddle with Sentences of Depoſition.</hi> It is anſwered, That the Council has not the power of Admiſſion and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Miniſters. But if a Miniſter having a lawful Call, the Presbyterie ſhould refuſe to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and Ordain him, albeit they have nothing to object againſt him, upon Application to the Council or Seſſion, Letters will be direct to Charge the Prebyterie, to Admit and Ordain him; but <hi>multo magis</hi> in this caſe, where a Miniſter is depoſed from his Miniſtrie; as likewiſe from his Benefice, (which is his Livelyhood and Maintenance) And yet moſt unjuſtly, and without Ground or Reaſon; The Council is the moſt propper Judge, for reſtoring him againſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Oppreſſion, Injury, and Unjuſt Sentence.</p>
               <p>And for a farther evidence of this unjuſt Sentence, it is Humbly deſired, that the LORDS of Their <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> Privy Council will be pleaſed to take notice, That in the firſt Lybel there are many Articles which are not Relevant; and it is ſaid, that there is none of them proven, but the Dancing about the Bonfire: And yet the Presbytery by their Sentence, found the Lybel Relevant and Proven, which muſt be underſtood as to the hail Articles of the Lybel complexlie, then which there is nothing more falſe, as will appear by the Lybels and Depoſitions, if they were produced. And yet thereupon Mr <hi>Heriott</hi> is firſt ſuſpended be the Presbytery, and referred be them to the General Aſſembly for farther Cenſure, as if great Immorralities in Life, and Errors in Doctrine, had been proven againſt him. And the Synod (to which the Aſſembly remitted him) following the ſteps of the Presbytery, depoſed him. Now when Presbytery and Synod, have acted thus contrare to expreſs Law, and have done open and manifeſt Unjuſtice; (and whereof all that heard of it are convinced and ſenſible) And having ſtated themſelves Parties againſt him, there can be no Remedy expected from the ſaid Unjuſtice, Injury, and Oppreſſion, unleſs the Lords of Their Majeſties Privy Council interpoſe their Authority.</p>
               <p>If it be alleaged, That be the late Act of Parliament, The Act of Supremacy in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is Reſcinded; It is Anſwered, That the Act of Parliament 1669 is Reſcinded, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Supremacy to the Ordering and Diſpoſal of the External Government and Policy of the Church, and to the Enacting of Conſtitutions, Acts, and Orders in the Church. But the foreſaid Act of K: <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. his 8th Parliament, is not Reſcinded, which is only as to the Judging of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Perſons in matters complained upon; And which power is inherent to the Crown, otherwayes there ſhould be <hi>Regnum in Regno;</hi> And Church Judicatories ſhould have Arbitrary power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Redreſs or Controul, as ſaid is.</p>
               <p>And whereas, ſome Perſons have ſtrongly aſſerted, to the Lords of Their Majeſties Privy Council and others. 1<hi>mo.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> was never re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight of the Lybels and Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, but that they were given him. 2<hi>do.</hi> That the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> were removed out of the Synod, upon Mr <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Declinator againſt them. It is Anſwered, 1<hi>mo.</hi> That he did many times, and with great earneſtneſs, crave a ſight of the Lybels and Depoſitions, both in the Aſſembly and Synod; which was refuſed as a hundred perſons who heard him will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; none of the Clerks of Aſſembly, Synod, or Presbytery (in whoſe hands and cuſtody the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Depoſitions are) will dare to affirm that ever they were given to Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> to ſee. 2<hi>do.</hi> Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> at his firſt appearance before the Synod, Declined the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> from being his Judges, they being his Parties: And before Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> gave in his Appeal, he was four times removed while the Synod conſidered the Defences, he made for himſelf; and none of the Synod can affirm, that the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> were removed with him; but at his return after the ſeveral Removals, he found them alwayes preſent, and the ſaid <hi>Alexander Calderwood:</hi> And ſeveral others of their number did in face of the Synod debate againſt him, when he made his Legal Defences: Which, the Synod having unjuſtly repelled; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Appealled, and immediately came away; ſo that there is nothing more certain, then that the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood,</hi> ſat as his Judges after Declinator. And it was upon theſe two grounds among the reſt, that Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> Appealled from the Synod; Becauſe they refuſed him a ſight of the Lybel &amp; Depoſitions, which Law allowed him; and that the Ptesbytery &amp; <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> ſat as his Judges, albeit they were his Parties, which is certainly true. And albeit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Appeal, and Mr <hi>Heriot</hi>'s going away, the Presbytery and <hi>Calderwood</hi> were removed, at the time of the Vote of Mr <hi>Heriot</hi>'s predetermined Depoſition; it doth not take away the truth of the reaſon of the Appeal, That they ſat as Judges before the Appeal.</p>
               <p>And whereas, beſides the falſe Alleadgance of Dancing about a Bonfire, there is now other Articles ſuggeſted to be proven. Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> makes no Anſwer thereto, becauſe of the unceriain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, hoping that the Lords of Their Majeſties Privy Council, will in their Juſtice, and conform to Law, Ordain the Lybels and Depoſitions of Witneſſes to be ſeen, and then Mr <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> can openly clear himſelf, from whatever ſhall appear to be proven againſt him.</p>
